## Featured Project: Comprehensive Capstone Service

This project showcases my ability to manage complex architecture, implement DevOps, and optimize performance.

### Project: ScoopADive
* **Architecture:** Implemented a containerized environment using **Docker**, managing separate containers for the Django web application, Nginx reverse proxy, and database.
* **Deployment:** Designed and executed a seamless **CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions** for automated build, testing, and deployment onto an **AWS Lightsail** instance.
* **Key Functionality:** Central features were enabled by integrating multiple external services, including the **OpenAI API** for AI-driven tasks and the **Fishial.ai API** for specialized domain data.
* **Performance:** Achieved significant system optimization by utilizing **Redis** for in-memory caching and configuring **AWS CloudFront/S3** for efficient, low-latency static content delivery.
